# Computers for an AI

I started to like Omen family of computers from HP: the first of two suggestions from ChatGPT. It features Intel processor and nVidia's video card with matrix and tensor processors (CUDA and related technology). It has a nice cover and the style is either bold for gamers, when the lights are on, or minimalist for science, if the lights are off.

Use the ChatGPT to:
- Estimate the income for your cue of projects, or the single projects; how you can use AI to optimize your performance and add intelligence. For example, given your complete website and the services an AI would provide, how the income and sustainability model would work. This holds for commercial, free or community projects, also instead of money, you can optimize costs of your free service, such as food for the poor.
- Parametrize the resource needs: how many different users you would have, what is the peak; what kind of and how much software you would use, and which are the parameters, which enable some income, and which are the possible developments and advancements.
- How much work you would do.
- In nighttime, holidays etc., are there times with so few users that mainteance would work smoothly.

## Using the nighttime

Web pages were usually maintained at nighttime - as more complex the mainteance, as more surely (sometimes, the system would not be down in this time, where we cannot be sure in this).

Where there are less clients at nighttime:
- At daytime, you would provide service: deploy an AI.
- At nighttime, you would use the same resource to fine-tune the AI, serving some occasional clients.
