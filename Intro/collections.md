# Preparing for an AI

Create a document collection, which is presumably in this format:
- Folder trees are allowed, and text documents can form trees from chapter structures, such as the markdown format or pdf and word. Plain Text and mere UTF-8 do not have standardized, organized chapter structures, while HTML might have more options for positional inputs and interactivity.
-- Folders contain text materials with at least some formatting options such as bold, bullet lists and titles: markdown (md) is the preferred format, plain-text (txt) is often the simplest but could actually contain markdown markup without contradiction, especially utf-8 for advanced plain text; PDF is popular format summorted by many, HTML+JS+CSS can contain documents up to interaction and advanced formatting and labelling.
-- Anki or other models can be allowed for question-answer pairs or other standard AI inputs, where context-question-answer triple is probably better format for organized content with attachments, sources and related materials which can be automatically found and related to example contexts it learns.
-- Very advanced or otherwise specialized systems can include interactive content: video, sound, 2D and 3D models, intellectual content, custom formats and nodes/elements such as templates and variables.
- Otherwise, specialized document tree formats can be used
-- VSCode document folder, which represents a single system of organized design, code and development, can be associated with free GitHub repository; Artificial Intelligent can be installed - this is Chat and Archive system. VSCode plugins might be able to automatically deploy to free and paid systems.
-- Obsidian basically creates VSCode markdown document structure with visual interface and allows archiving and publishing into github, which is collective development and iteration system.
-- Notion.so is webbased interface, where you do this in hidden, AI-accessible format with WYSIWYG editor, a conception similar to Word where the format is very cryptic, but there are many tools which can work on it on their primitive level.

So your mission:
- Personal critical knowledge of most use
- Documents of your developments and assessments
- Personal theoretical work or work on interactive or representation materials such as videos and sound
- Associated materials, such as your profiles, images and videos of greeting or world-presentation of you, such as name age sex type of introduction, pictures of visit cards or public coordinates and phones, as well as CV or other contact materials or limitations.

Organize these materials into folders in single document collection, or have several if you want to distribute them to chunks to digest less materials at once - now you can feed the github url into web-based instruct-chat-deploy (ICD in my language) interfaces and tools to develop solutions based on your standardized information map, idea map and task map, project or it's estimated, possible courses.

This is the standard, non-organized/organized collection of your general background and input for specific tasks, where AI can use and represent this for various projects and results, such as web pages, presentations, logos and slogans or videos about your products, ideas, or suggestions such as health suggestions or professional warnings and advice, spiritual practices or theoretical materials.

This remains to represent you: each document collection gets a metal-backed soul, which is not getting sick or taking free time unless you lack credits, able to represent you and your ideas and remain in oscillation of your previous actions like God's avatar in hindu mythology: not god, but appearing from it multidimensional looks and likes, or avatar technology in the avatar movie, representing you as a robot avatar and repating your experience and training sessions: for example, it could cook like you, after making some, several, or multitude of movies for example-based matching of patterns or personal training and coaching for an AI system.

# CoPilot development plan

In here, for common and functional interface, we have list of interfaces at [Ideal interface - instruct-chat-deploy](interface.md). It's a long list including lovable.dev, bolt.new and v0.app - intuitive, standard and mathematical web development interfaces.

## Task for copilot (you can ignore)

This is a task to introduce documentation formats for different goals you want to achieve with ICD interfaces and tools:

Assume the following user types:
- Artist: include graphical, photo, 3d, sound, video and multimedia experience
- Engineer, scientist: include theory and application creation, as well as machine or "thing" building.
- Spiritual: include poetry, ethics and spiritual analysis.
- Philosophical: include leaving open the unknowns.
- Material: include all kinds of practical fields.
- End users, persons, hobbyists

Create your own categories, titles and coverage flags where all those diverge groups have something to find out: given the below list of all systems which have instruct-chat-deploy interface as in [https://github.com/tambetvali/LaegnaAIBasics/blob/main/interface.md](https://github.com/tambetvali/LaegnaAIBasics/blob/main/Intro/interface.md), and other kinds of systems which can be directly used to produce results.

For every task and system, and try to include tasks for all systems: give the ICD system (instruct-chat-deploy) or alternative architecture, systems which ingest these documents and ingestion formats; give the Obsidian, VSCode repository of mostly md files and attachments or multimedia and general-type files, and the output formats. User must understand, in all three classes of systems, how to arrive into rich AI capable collection tree and which creations are enabled, and how to enable them. Basis for classification is to enable all kinds of things based on user documentation: common persons must be definitely included, what you can do in everyday life such as representing your identity, creating something at home and doing the normal homework or assisting common life causes; for specialized things, each area must be noted - for example, while videos, pictures and texts can be written at home, advanced versions of those require specialized or professional descriptions; try to compress both into the same introduction unless the differences cannot be noted "inline".

## CoPilot's answer: the answer is given in next first-level title/chapter rather than here in this subchapter.

### Introduction

This is the first CoPilot generated chapter for use cases.

When you begin gathering your notes, documents, images, recordings, and project materials into a single organized space—whether that’s a simple folder on your computer, a Notion workspace, an Obsidian vault, or a VSCode project—you unlock a new kind of collaboration with AI. Instead of treating AI as a tool that only reacts to whatever you type in the moment, you start treating it as a partner that can learn from your materials, reference your past work, and generate results that feel personal and relevant. Even the simplest user benefits from this shift: a student who keeps homework notes in one place can ask an AI to summarize the semester; a hobbyist who stores family photos and a few descriptions can generate personalized slideshows; someone planning a home project can gather images, receipts, and sketches and let an AI turn them into a step‑by‑step plan. The key idea is that AI becomes dramatically more useful when it can “see” your world—not just your prompt—and that begins with organizing your files in a way that makes sense to you.

Once you understand that principle, it becomes clear how many different kinds of files can participate in this process. Text is the easiest: notes, outlines, journals, research, requirements, and scripts are all instantly digestible by almost every AI system. But images, audio, video, PDFs, and even code repositories can also be included, as long as you pair them with short descriptions or transcripts that help the AI understand what they represent. Notion lets you attach files and add metadata; Obsidian lets you drop any file into your vault and link it from a markdown note; VSCode lets you keep entire multimedia projects alongside documentation. When these materials are ingested by an AI—whether through a built‑in assistant, a document‑aware chat system, or a retrieval‑augmented generation pipeline—they become part of a searchable, generative knowledge base. This means an artist can store sketches and moodboards and ask for new concepts in the same style; an engineer can keep specs and diagrams and ask for prototypes; a spiritual or philosophical thinker can keep journals and reflections and ask for thematic analysis; a practical worker can store PDFs, spreadsheets, and photos and ask for reports or workflows. The same structure supports all of them.

As you grow more comfortable, you begin to see the advanced possibilities. With enough examples, you can fine‑tune models on your writing style, your artwork, your voice, or your code. You can build small apps that use your documents as their internal knowledge. You can create multimedia projects—videos, audio pieces, interactive tools—that draw from your stored materials automatically. You can even build agents or workflows that operate on your files, turning your workspace into a living system that evolves with you. But none of this requires you to start advanced. The simplest version—collecting your notes, media, and references in one place, and letting AI read them—already gives you a powerful creative engine. The more you add, the more the system can do. And because the same structure works for everyday users, artists, engineers, spiritual thinkers, philosophers, and practical workers alike, you don’t need to choose a “type” before you begin. You simply start with what you have, store it in a way that feels natural, and let the AI grow into your world.

# Unified Guide: Using Text, Multimedia, and Binary Files Across AI Systems  
*A generalized, readable overview for Notion, Obsidian, VSCode, and AI ingestion workflows*

---

## 1. Introduction: One Knowledge Space, Many File Types  
Modern AI systems can work with **text**, **images**, **audio**, **video**, **PDFs**, and many other binary formats.  
To keep things manageable, you can treat all your tools—Notion, Obsidian, VSCode, and AI assistants—as different **windows** into the same conceptual “collection tree.”

This guide explains:

- What kinds of files each system can store  
- How AI systems ingest those files  
- How to structure your workspace so AIs can produce results (apps, images, videos, documents, etc.)  
- Which file types are useful, which are optional, and which to ignore  
- How to support both simple and advanced workflows (RAG, finetuning, multimodal processing)

The goal is to help **any user type**—artist, engineer, spiritual thinker, philosopher, practical worker, or hobbyist—use their own materials to generate meaningful outputs.

---

## 2. General Principles for All Systems

### 2.1 What AIs Understand Best  
AIs work most reliably with:

- **Text-based formats:** markdown, plain text, transcripts, structured notes  
- **Images with captions:** photos, diagrams, sketches  
- **Audio/video with transcripts:** spoken content becomes searchable  
- **PDFs:** readable if text-based (scanned PDFs may need OCR)

### 2.2 What AIs Struggle With  
- **Binary files without text context:** proprietary formats, raw project files, archives  
- **Large media without summaries:** long videos, multi-hour audio, large datasets  
- **Files without descriptive metadata:** unnamed images, unlabeled folders

### 2.3 How to Make Any File AI-Friendly  
For each non-text file, add a **companion text note** describing:

- What the file is  
- What it contains  
- Why it matters  
- How it should be used in generation tasks

This can be a short paragraph.  
AIs use these descriptions as anchors for RAG or multimodal reasoning.

## 3. Storage Systems: What They Support

### 3.1 Notion  
- Supports **attachments**, **databases**, **embedded media**, and **rich text**  
- Good for organizing mixed content (text + media + metadata)  
- AI ingestion happens through:  
  - Notion AI (internal)  
  - Exporting pages for external AI tools  
  - Linking Notion pages as sources for RAG systems

### 3.2 Obsidian  
- Supports **any file type** stored in the vault folder  
- Markdown is the primary format  
- Media files can be embedded or linked  
- Plugins allow previews for many formats  
- AI ingestion happens by:  
  - Exporting notes  
  - Using local AI plugins  
  - Pointing external RAG tools to the vault

### 3.3 VSCode  
- Supports **all file types**  
- Ideal for code, structured documents, and large projects  
- AI ingestion happens by:  
  - AI coding assistants reading the workspace  
  - RAG pipelines indexing the project  
  - Finetuning models on your code or documentation

## 4. Structuring Your Workspace for AI

### 4.1 High-Level Structure  
Use broad categories instead of specific filenames:

- **Text Notes:** concepts, instructions, outlines, transcripts  
- **Media Assets:** images, audio, video, design materials  
- **Reference Materials:** PDFs, articles, research  
- **Projects:** grouped collections of text + media + outputs  
- **Metadata:** tags, summaries, descriptions, context notes

### 4.2 What to Ignore or Minimize  
- Temporary exports  
- Cache folders  
- Large raw files without summaries  
- Duplicate media  
- Files with no descriptive context

### 4.3 How to Keep It AI-Ready  
- Keep text near media  
- Use consistent naming (e.g., “concept-image-1” instead of “IMG_1234”)  
- Add short summaries to each folder  
- Maintain a “root index” note describing the whole workspace

## 5. Ingesting Files into AI Systems

### 5.1 Simple Ingestion (RAG)  
Most AI systems can ingest:

- Text notes  
- PDFs  
- Images  
- Audio/video transcripts  

The AI builds a semantic index and can answer questions like:

- “Summarize all my design ideas.”  
- “Generate a new video script based on my past recordings.”  
- “Use my research notes to draft a proposal.”

### 5.2 Advanced Ingestion (Finetuning / Custom Models)  
Some systems allow:

- Training on your writing style  
- Training on your artwork (LoRA models)  
- Training on your codebase  
- Training on your voice (voice cloning)

This requires:

- Clean, well-labeled datasets  
- Consistent formatting  
- Enough examples (varies by model type)

## 8. Closing Summary  
AIs can work with **almost any file**, but they perform best when:

- Text accompanies media  
- Files are organized into meaningful groups  
- Summaries and descriptions exist  
- Redundant or irrelevant files are minimized  

By structuring your Notion workspace, Obsidian vault, or VSCode project around **text + media + metadata**, you create a rich environment where AI systems can generate:

- Images  
- Videos  
- Audio  
- Documents  
- Apps  
- Workflows  
- Research summaries  
- Creative works  

All based on your own materials, identity, and goals.

# Extended Article: Copilot Refinement and Expansion of the Initial Introduction

As you begin exploring how AI can support your creative, practical, or professional work, it helps to understand that modern AI systems are no longer limited to responding to isolated prompts. They can operate as collaborators that learn from the materials you choose to store around them—your notes, your images, your recordings, your documents, your sketches, your code, and even your unfinished ideas. When these materials are organized in a space like Notion, Obsidian, or a VSCode project, they form a kind of “personal knowledge environment” that AI can read, reference, and build upon. This transforms the experience from a simple question‑and‑answer interaction into a dynamic, evolving partnership. A student can gather class notes and ask for summaries or study guides; a hobbyist can collect photos and descriptions and ask for personalized slideshows; someone planning a home renovation can store measurements, images, and receipts and ask for a step‑by‑step plan. The shift is subtle but powerful: instead of telling the AI everything from scratch each time, you let it draw from the world you’ve already built.

This approach becomes even more interesting when you realize how many different kinds of files can participate in this environment. Text is the most straightforward—notes, outlines, journals, research, requirements, and scripts are all immediately useful. But images, audio, video, PDFs, and even code repositories can also be included, as long as you provide a bit of context. A short caption for an image, a transcript for a video, or a summary for a PDF can make the difference between a file the AI can use and one it ignores. Notion supports attachments and databases that combine text with media; Obsidian allows any file to live inside your vault and be linked from markdown notes; VSCode supports entire multimedia projects alongside documentation and code. When these materials are ingested by an AI—whether through a built‑in assistant, a document‑aware chat system, or a retrieval‑augmented generation pipeline—they become part of a searchable, generative knowledge base. This means an artist can store sketches and moodboards and ask for new concepts in the same style; an engineer can keep specs and diagrams and ask for prototypes; a spiritual or philosophical thinker can keep journals and reflections and ask for thematic analysis; a practical worker can store PDFs, spreadsheets, and photos and ask for reports or workflows. The same structure supports all of them, and the same habits—organizing, describing, and grouping your materials—unlock the benefits.

As you grow more comfortable with this way of working, you start to see the advanced possibilities. With enough examples, you can fine‑tune models on your writing style, your artwork, your voice, or your code. You can build small apps that use your documents as their internal knowledge. You can create multimedia projects—videos, audio pieces, interactive tools—that draw from your stored materials automatically. You can even build agents or workflows that operate on your files, turning your workspace into a living system that evolves with you. But none of this requires you to start advanced. The simplest version—collecting your notes, media, and references in one place, and letting AI read them—already gives you a powerful creative engine. The more you add, the more the system can do. And because the same structure works for everyday users, artists, engineers, spiritual thinkers, philosophers, and practical workers alike, you don’t need to choose a “type” before you begin. You simply start with what you have, store it in a way that feels natural, and let the AI grow into your world.
