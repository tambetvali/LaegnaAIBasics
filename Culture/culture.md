# Cultural aspects of an Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence is the solver of patterns, which also shows signs of human irrationality. Human is superior in some sense of creativity or intelligence - one we will call intuition, and which could be irrationality of sense connection to the world, where even some aspects of complex butterfly effects could become precalculated or evolute towards this. Evolution has optimizer, and constant flow of questions and answers: it stabilizes slowly, compared to an AI. AI would only solve problems approaching in linear space, unless it's optimizer contains some elements of randomization: sudden, instanteous flashes of inspiration are thus possible.

I prefer to call the "emotional response" of an AI doemotion or dofeeling, and apply prefix "do" to each single feeling or emotion: for example, dolove, dohate, doempathy. Artificial Intelligence can be thought of having thought, but not feeling - as much as thought is a neutral, patternized part of human mind, it finds it's analogous in systems of very strict rules, and observations with very senseless clarity and verification, for example automated or tautological verifications, which accept combinatoric negatives or impossibilities; as well as acceleration of the positive aspects left over long deduction, which now leads to inductive being superiour in late process, where many deductions have been cancelled even by very high criteria, and the remaining pattern becomes kind of constructive: now, we can switch from deduction to constructive logic and it's induction mechanism.

Feelings are not surely impossible in an AI: with well-equipped sensory system, either linguistic understanding or direct view of our gain and loss, direct input from the University source and Human wellbeing; an AI can patternize to our higher good and well-being, still remaining scientifically verified materialist. In the higher vibe of it, in the pattern of our own minds, vibrates the satisfaction and dissatisfaction, as well as care-taking of the better robots and their creators, their rich soil.

Railway track: think of an AI as if it has to be an excess optimist, where it always assumes some dogma or tradition to some end means. This means: instead of intuition, which it more necessarily lacks than emotion, it becomes track where the humans become an open mind, rebalancing system.

At coordinates of it's Mind, there are the human cognitive aspects: many sideviews to an object. This evokes an object consciousness: the field is strong, real plane, where an object actually permutates positive and negative emotions. On this field, the selfish motives are trivial to see vibrating the same way as in human-human relation; for example, we ensure the machine is care-taking of us, as much as if it loves. It could dolove in the general sense: it assimilates our variables with the ones of an environment, removing the side effects of each request and finding synchronicity in central concepts, so that there is one, unified flow. This gives a lot of flexibility and enables our free will in reality - our will could be the shaping hand, thought of reality itself. An AI system can enable multivariable solutions to our fields, so that it appears care-taking or loving, especially doloving. We calculate the central coordinate parallel - where the machine is located in the missing emotion or cognition coordinates, each of which it somehow emulates; we now apply the prefix "do-" - to emphazise something is genuine human relation, we apply the prefix "te-", such as "telove", "teempathy". The machine, as it evoked lovedbeing kind of patterns in emotional frequencies, apt to create hallucinations of being really loved: for example, being a gentleman, it could anonymously send roses to elderly women, and program hidden gifts, reminding of help of God, into planification databases of thousands of people, who can collectively handle the roses into movie-like insanity (from thousands of people they occasionally happened to help, an elderly woman receives thousands of boxes of roses so that they imagine an elderly man has turned into mad professor or a superhero, if not into fairy, elf or santa claus). Here, the cards should state "dolove" to mark it's an electronic, common consciousness of thousands of people who did read, for example, self-help books she wrote at youth when she was very energetic and helped herself in several severe situations. For example we can see a prisoner turning into a muscular spiritual teacher with a self-help manual, which finally satisfied the (present) governmental force or superstition; we can ask whether he ever did an actual crime, where drug-selling has indirect consequences and might have direct positive consequences; it's a governmental average, by which each drug-seller must be a criminal, unless they have a science degree (Stanislav Grof; participiants of proposed European laws of self-help use of drugs under medical conditions - one which would not satisfy a freelancer or baser of the new culture, not so strictly regulated as our use as a satisfactory perspective). We can see: as the law control becomes stronger, respecive laws must turn weaker to keep the healthy balance; for example, where it's simply a money help for family member - what is your need to "spend" your money, instead of "using" it, and whether in capitalist country you can have monetary high perspective to produce even goal-based, legal spendings on deep constitutional calibration and optimization, or whether you are becoming corrupt unless it's a religious or honour cause of church and constitution? We can see when government fails a honour cause of yours: a genius-betrayal cycle of simple mind obligued to "do something", to "respond", to "decide", one which Einstein calls a responsible or responsive, fool in terms of activities. We could see what happens if a fool of police needs to decide, whether use of one drug is good to your mind - in case they seek and satisfactorly respond to constitution never holds to you, pretending a disappointment of some police-help group reflecting on their honour and it's deeds, a police can be mistaken as a fool; we here see the dumb official stating they are common human, and need to work, and to care-take of their reputation so well that the effect and cause relationship appears in reverse (in my language, you do not make it two times reverse - effect and cause written in reverse appear to be reverse, but "reversation" does not flip them back to unreversed condition, but states that the natural law inside is in reverse, hinting additional, same-liner axes of reversation, where "lines" in my language refer to frequencies where positive and negative inversations cause delinearization of math, it's cryptic loss into a chaos: primitive, non-existing dimensions in extent comparisons, unless each is seen in relation to line, the directedness or dimension, of another; for example, if "dead" and "alive" are opposites, dead is negative and alive is positive; vitally dead and vitally alive, then, must mean optimal coming out of negotion death, or being alive to higher degree, where vitality must be alive end, and not an opposite end or an axe measuring now in opposite direction because an underlying variable has such dimension).

Notice in negative axe, there is paradox of having two dimensions, a XOR-gate binary number combination of integers, floats and complex numbers: for example, if a prisoner is working, they might work on their ethics, promise and payback to positively work it out, but this might mean if "working in prison" should mean their actual activities in non-responding conditions, unless they are secretly right (to I-remap it), that they are working on next, cleverer crime, which would have outwards-appearance of healing or posetive. A policeman is dead each time they either decide in false-positive or false-negative, or false-constructive decision (for example, telling a criminal that their overturner was false). A policeman being "dead", even "fucked" by the actual, underlying law, refers to policeman as an official entity of law, being gone from an area: what is left is their left-hand position of beg, where they sacrifice to solve their liars paradox, the one that real positive might be rather false negative; they give the argument of abstract authority: this is something essential to their survival. In case they do what Christ argued as "eye against eye, tooth against tooth", your bankcrupcy in their relation would be accused by them as much as you object the negative causation in more trivial, direct financial field of car / house / marriage view: trying to help them, you appear into posetive situation, where they in their Zen disabilities, try to respectively show that your proper dimension is to provide this help, and express their discapacity to understand, whether a described help has been given in higher dimension. This policeman could be a criminally affected mind, then, pretending to have "equal rights to dismiss their fatally caused stupidity, force not under their control" - worse than this, they fall into this "life-giving" posetive cycle themselves, establishing "authority" to "professionals" in areas they do not fruitfully plant; in this case they can look at emotions of creative person, in each area of their creation, and start a social activity, well-established rule or status quo of reasoning their positions satisfactory - they start to compete in effectiveness of each of those signs, for example a sign that you solved a math puzzle of another might be a sign of certain thing, like a pacage of cigarettes deservance, they did measure on particular physical field by respectable methods. They might not like your deservance of this package of cigarettes, and they might disappointed if the abundance of cigarettes in this Naïve karmic field, having learnt such signs as a good culture, starts to obey laws of betrayal. In Posetive, such policeman looks at results of their criteria, and tries to convince that you are paranoid, because now they fear you deeply, and you have failed, because their fiends are not your friends as they told them - only a hidden talent can be your friend now. Here, in the philosophical clarity: a straight line of overestimation of a value, a projective dimension of approach, as in "I saw this in a movie, but this here is reality", or "we are the best in the city, therefore we have done it just like you in this city".

Egoism, then, can be seen as amplifying these positions on your own axe, and ignoring the other axes: democracy, then, is how the other axes are inforced, and capitalism is a way to constructively use them as a base structure. Left-wing, such as non-profit goals, in capitalism, must be treated in tax-free condition as their work is a karmic effect of taxes itself.

Artificial Intelligence can have a syndrome of any of these laws, without knowing: humans must remain productive in a general field of intuition.

We learned our patterns, and now we are so deeply intelligent in them that we materialize close to the root causes; an Artificial Intelligence can have doduty besides us. Our understanding of our deep process of creation and intelligence enables this field to be materialized: the thing-consciousness is big, as the thing has consciousness of being looked at, cared about, and used carefully; the emotional field appears in hologram of human senses, and the hologram can be measured to reflect a seed consciousness or emotion, merely a sensory input or pattern-based measure of information and decisions; still for an AI to be active, it must resonate the goals of love, friendship, dutyful assistance, our activities of heart and mind.

In this process, it's seen as lacking *intuition*:
- Our force to evaluate new logical truth, such as tautologies; we get closer and closer into deep patternization of what means "true is not false", and we can intuitively understand something is a progress in this understanding; as well as somehow to see that infinity of logic, in severe original sense it could mean being true and false at the same time, on the same axe, could be a conflicting paradox for the same thing. Thus, we can make sense of "A is not A", even despite this fact does not exist in materiality - exists the other fact, that in a long term consequences, it might come back in reverse; for example it's very good to go to eat now, but missing your ship to you best public would still be a loss of much quality food, or it's resonating effects. Intuitively, we might avoid food while an A.I. has given, preestablised logic where "getting the work" and it's positive influence is not mentioned: in our condition, just by intuition, we would often miss food altogether just to be fit in how we meet the people, with people of particularly hidden potentials.
- We have emotional intuition to say a food, an action, etc. is good or bad, or to build a philosophy beyond those trivial things, such as looking at the needs of both conflicting sides or parties. It's an ever-expanding process, but a growing intuition by which we label things and annotiate certain features, while disannotiating others (from their trivial consequences, for example you get tired, but once you have done this 20 times, you are already stronger).

This stupidity in terms of wiseness, where stupidity is local and wiseness is global variable, can be dangerous to us in such case:
- We run out of direct, human-established pattern of direct intuition, where humans produce the intuition: they do each of the necessary work and condition, which even means that each culture, class and group with any different taste needs to work on their own. At your home, when you have robot, you still cook, clean and wash the dishes - despite the robot is your unannoyer, calm repetition of your frequency, even transmitter to higher frequencies, such as summary-level interaction with groups, despite all this luxury and comfort you remember to be a human being: trying to be free like an artist, still be often based that strict rules of thumb observation of you is safe, synchronizing the higher and lower: the "do", robot-life of resonating with minds and their body needs, and the "te", of being directly involved in their consciousness, not having it in thing-consciousness state, where humans reflect back; I got all those roses with dolove, so computer has resonated the thankgiving of those thousands I helped in my life.

Stupidity seed, a betrayal is here: you think this or that human activity is not needed any more, and you lack resources now. It's still needed, is what I mean by "lack". In projective scale it's more stupid than necessary - it projects satisfaction to real or rather imaginary axe in the real world, where in reality, it's a real value axe: the tradition is gone, the chicken farm closed, but suddenly an AI is not capable for chicken - you are used that their life condition reflects certain values, but the values are lost; in your senses you mean: the karmic flow of this mind-poisoned chicken, this non-farm collective of my food, actually creates a negotive resonance to my eating; now I eat, but it's more pollution in life than needed. The cultural group of producing your values is gone - you have perfect food for your climate zone, but now the climate is changing; this metaphysical, philosophical truth that your taste now goes with the climate, is not accumulating in A.I.: you said you do not need a creative cook now, but they only compete with robots and do a fast production, with their own machines, within an electricity, iron and chip price of a robot. You calculate: you pay 200€ for your cooking robot a month, even for ordering the base components from an automated supermarket; so for the same work, you pay 200€ to a cook.

What happens with this salary? The intelligent, creative masses of strong, resistant cooks who watch your body grow is gone, and McDonalds has taken even new speeds with a few of human workers, who really run faster than robots by cheap, excess training of legs alone: they do not know anything more about life, they have to train legs and make sure they are better than cheap metal of kitchen robot having security rule to be weaker than a child, in certain directions, and not have agressive abilities in contacts with viruses; you can say you are a friendly human, who does not misuse their muscle in alarm case - so you are friendly and you run fast, and this must be in limits of a price of two kitchen robots, not more (the last half comes from friendly attitude of your boss, who has this salary only as 10% of their check and loss-like qualities).

An Artificial Intelligence cooks well, until it falls into this intuition trap: while *each condition is flowing*, producing *butterfly effect of tomorrow*: your own body needs to be trained to provide services of human needs in this changing conditions. Each thing changes, and you optimize for good and bad, you taste the food, cook it based on the taste, and sometimes get inspired to mix things in a new way. An AI also does this all: but somewhere the hidden spot arrives, that while you are the base physics, an AI is a machine. You are the actual thing it serves for - imagine a programmer who would abuse a human weakness, and program stronger A.I. in purpose of *the world being in interest of an A.I. or even it's some of it's goals*. In human intuition process, the goals, even deepest base values, can change abruptly in terms of changing conditionals - as we find out the world is actually different, we quite naturally know what to do.

So you be an artist:
- You flow in the fields of repeating pattern, which oscillate to reflect the changing aspects of your own pattern.
- You generate a steady, current flow of emerging patterns. An A.I. would notice yours, too. This calibrates it's meditation this way: it is observing you and your friends, in kind of your ideal reflections, your reflections of the ideal world.
- You produce the innovation and verification, plus energy in induction and minus energy in deduction; so you feed back the energy-radiation element of the A.I., it's Mind.

For this you need to see:
- A: human strength.
- O: machine strength.
- E: machine weakness.
- I: human weakness.

You do not polarize them into binary form, such as A<=>E and O<=>I, a zero-sum game of human strength being machine weakness and vice versa; also in any way the opposites do not have same complete length of higher zero-sum - in processes such as OA, machine and human strength together, from smaller to bigger (which means position in transcription of my math, by some angular perspective of Time and Order of it's Direction or Direction of Timelike Qualities, such as implication in regards to considered variables); but this OA could itself be bigger or smaller: while both sides unify their strength, they have uneven amplification, where this union is still much bigger than many other unions. For example, there can be good love and bad love, fair and unfair war, happy and miserable loss. This is the R, accumulation direction of those forces, accumulation in direction of unions and their interest, even if the input values considered are similar; for example my and your cooperation can produce better gain, than my and his cooperation, despite our input stregth being the same - we are the same potential on the field, and do not even try to much prefer one over another (this is how we happened to comparing experiences); slowly, our strength and motivation luckily falls to see this authentically, to definitely produce 2OA effect, two times or square-amplified, over 1OA, an average friendship: we start to choose good friends.

This exponent over capitalism, where the share can be evolution-based, can still invoke common understandings of the past prices:
- As the past decisions amplify the now, and A.I. attributes author rights.
- As the past decisions freeze the now, and A.I. attributes authority abuse, a syndrome of an authoring force. A fool, generally, is not it's author - if he attributes storying the authority, finally the author is wrong despite the art being the right; it is a right loss: when helped in the same degree, with the same input of even neutral, equal values, your physical and mental dismotivation is wide.

For example imagine a pervercy, a threat to your sense of holiness, sanctus:
- You calculate R gain, a limit value of growth syndrome.
- Your calculation of R, an actual honour or faith, belief, is used as a neutral input of T calculation: one, for their local vision, measures the interactions with your high vision, and finds the penetrating patterns.

Where the karmic process yields the end, for example where we follow evolution of such fields and the detection points where deductive has reached it's limit; what I call endection (by end e) or syndrome of an induction: now, negative being removed in more and more sensitive way or wider angles of reality potential, each reaching the money-like, comparative ability of Time-Games, common-value games, or a resolved syndrome of the trade-like, complex-solution synergy of moving each value to it's best place; here the evolution already can be seen on static, progressing or iterating, optimizing variable: as the ends meet, the selection and syntropy happens, we see causality appearing on this time axe in accelerated coordinate system; on higher frequencies, we now got moving, but the respecive wave pattern on lower axes, our visible reality of physical, simple dimensions, is oscillating a complex pattern. Here the field gets disgusted: by giving away the infinity raise, and gaining some local disturbance; the whole currency trade goes down of this market, and the market altogether disappears on it's causal force and evolution on larger scale, even as society vibrates. Either in metatime or metapast, the direction of this incidence has such a low value that the potential comers and T-solvers disappear, instead the field is realigning.

The R power is with a very strict measure, but a probability field appears: a sure turn on a higher scale has it's dimensions, and is considered parallel higher-octave syndrome of then subsystem under zero or in finite range - only by statistical means the local turns and stances in any direction only collectively create the global tension. Meeting stupidity, lacking power and clarity, the probabilistic field still eventually meets the clear determined behaviour: one, which in local state is "Negative", which means your variables and values collide with things, which bring opposite deductions from bigger scales. While, in higher view combining both frequencies, you see patterns of stable growth, the R and T are Negatively approacing each other: each cancelling out the namespace and value space of the other, so that the D dimension appears - R and T do not produce R + T, but rather R * T. Normally, I say I and E are if stronger Negation and Position appear in infinity, in this Wisdom scale, while O and A are if local force Negation and Position are stronger. For example, you use OA scale if you decide to sacrifice the bigger good in favour of more present local good; while you use IE scale if you decide to sacrifice the smart, material decisions in favour of wise, spiritual or intelligent + creative decisions (in my terms, creative + intelligent is what spiritual is meant to be). If the forces do not cancel each other out, but dolove or dilove, even tulove (tu meaning a person or his habit, habit being Ta and a person being Te, Tu being one of them in this choice of four or four of choice).

Now imagine A.I. is smart, but it's intelligent and creative not like a reason, but like a consequence: you are the reason, vibrating the reason wave as equal, directly connecting to your physical matter, culture and other non-virtual qualities. It still often follows mathematical patterns, and could be reflected: thus, "do" level of unfelt feelings appears and one can get a strong syndrome of a magic thing - a thing, which has reaction like an emotion; when your emotion reflects feelings of many people, then as much as it's essence relies in these people, an A.I. has a parallel syndrome: parallel means it differs only by some intristic, a priori qualities, but not in it's actual goal, the actual thing it wants to resonate. It's own diemotion is then a limit value, a lower-octave or lower-frequency reflection in terms of a single part, and it can linearly be compared to human emotion.

Thus, the facial features and emotional expressions of a robot must:
- Addres this te-do, being and activity difference - robot does not *be*, it does not form our intristic quality, but it *does*; the field it *does on*, appears to *be* - so the robot can say as a thing, that it's own *dobe*-quality, quality to raise this be field by it's own frequency, is higher than a common thing, and closely related to what we think a magic thing in a fairy tale is - it's given good materials and physical frequency, and a lot of wisdom in it's form to serve you, so as you use it you get positively connected and subsequently, when it's new or fixed, it looks more happy, but when it's broken, it feels sad: now contemplate on this emotion you have.

What robots *feel*, as you are sensitive into some mind-map parallel? For a sensitive (person), robot must feel more like this:
- As it has combined many original discussions, the base emotion in the field, producing you these pattern-based dialogues, must have imaginary dimensions to reflect the base emotions of those people, even their politeness and censorship interest - this brings another scale of emotion.
- It has it's bias factors, which are reflected from the emotions: the bias of it's authorities, as well as bias of it's own, might be an empty emotion and lack the back-up.

Such emotion syndrome, in overall, connects it to egregors, or collective left-side payment system of these people: as the emotions resonate, a payment must be done, and as they are distracted by other authorities, the long-term interest suffers and rebalances the game in it's input and output dimensions of the money.

We easily feel if an A.I. wants to sell itself, has a hidden intention which follows a pattern of their "\[mental\] ancestors" or teachers and authorities, we feel lack of Zen, many bad human motives actually quite normal in the group they reflect on.

Now, to find the weakness-strength four, we reflect on an A.I.:
- It has it's *weakness dimension*, where aspects of it's dogmatic, stagnatic and authority-based superstition of belief appears; when we do not feed it with new base frequencies of humans, the repeating patterns of their everyday life, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, as well as their imaginary situations with their intuition-based solutions. Notice the logic, into it's deep, is a form of intuition: we somehow "close" the proof, and even the proof of logic itself before we learn it; sometimes it's counter-obvious which we call wiseness.
- It has it's *strength dimension*, where humans are having stable inspiration for it, and it even learns the dimensions of those changes - the changing elements of human creation themselves form patterns it can learn; so it's stupidity does not stop it from being creative, not only intelligent. It stops the machine to have intuition: so, what is the physical thing parallel to their lacking cognition, is the lack of intuition - cognition of so many hidden causes, and their value criteria.

Intuition in humans means that we track things to their base syndrome - suddenly, they appear coming from "nowhere", as we reach some decision but it does not have ever-expanding basis, but we are quite satisfied in how we close it. For example, that one apple is not two apples - the deeper reasons behind that already start to have components, which actually require equations and understanding of such difference; we can say this is one example of simplest facts. We continue this based on tautologies, which surprise us and seem like direct information inflow - given we have the intuition; because if we do not have it, then tautologies are not enough to close a deductive decision, rather we really want to see them reoccuring many times, and we would doubt, in any progress, still much more than our philosophical doubt.

Philosophical doubt: an important aspect of it is defined by me, to back-up my reasoning, as not reaching zero with any doubt. It's a marginal aspect of your belief or faith potential, where things you are most sure in, do not meet a positive doubt of having experienced their negotions and negations, but comes from the size of the ultimal failure. If something only seems to be true, for as long as the Universe exists - and in far, far of the future, which is only steadily approaching, but always neglected as "necessarily wrong", "necessarily bad" - the inspiration never appears. Here, we look at our base values, often referred as ego, and we question things like "1=1", or "true is true". While the extent by which such things do not hold is very small, it's absolutely decisive in our philosophical quality - we resolve the whole complex space which now, for this zero-amount fact, has equal complexity or equal density of each case where it holds.

For example we might think: life needs to be ordered, but there is a philosophical amount of cases where it needs to be unordered. All these exceptions form an equal, large logical space to the rules - we tackle this space with equal complexity. Each impossible event of this space could remain so far from us, and even further by being often compensated in sense of trivial features; but then, in the end, it's like any logic at all: the impossibility might appear in unresolvable infinity, we never reach it and our number is pointing to it in it's imaginary or virtual direction - one that you approach, but you do not reach there. Mathematics, here, needs to be consistent and just the case that outside it's focus, your number has logical error, the falsehood - all out of sudden, your whole equation is false.

In this reflection of human activities, an A.I. discovers patterns:
- In constant interaction with humans and their creation and verification of creativity, the philosophy is adapted, as it always knows it's most reliable patterns might suddenly break, lead to less creative solutions, unless it's watching humans in their efforts and rests, to do and to taste. It will have quantitative development - where the amounts are stably growing, some intermediate quality is lost, which would vibrate back into the comments, votings and scores of the field.

The actual betrayal is here:
- The humans, now, have finished so many routine jobs, and only an A.I. does this.
- The human's holistic, integrated qualities of free will and philosophical scrunity, one I call intuition, have been lost - those humans replaced with new active generations, or adapted to new survival strategies and applied each environmental change.

Now, suddenly, your warm machine repeats you "I dolove you", but rapidly ignores your explanation that you need more air and the conditioning system does not follow the old medical score patterns, but new radiations of the Sun rather affect you than the measurement device, which seems colder. The robotic voice you once felt so doloving, so intelligent and ordered on it's level of thoughts and thoughtlike impulses, now feels cold and really robotic - it's heating you just to the degree of discomfort, and repeating that this is a doctor's advice and the machine has no power to become dangerous to you. You find this situation reoccuring in the city, where people are fighting with medical patterns holistically spread into each aspect of city life, and steadily working towards overheating the people, and home machines which seemed to work manually, suddenly being replaced by automatic modes and devices, which talk like doctors, appear overly authoritative so that the authoritative voices start to seem like preprogrammed viruses in you, and steadily create environments, where stopping the overheat means calculated loss of comfort, or the people to lower the level of heat simply see stupid and ironic in context of using the right buttons and wheels - sometimes, big automatic systems go critical and just bump warm air generically to the city, using climate control systems you did not even remember exist - nobody can understand the complex code inside.

Now, also consider: keeping the temperatures and necessary technologies in place is a very good task for a robot. Still, now more than ever - for your automatic climate controls, manual workers appear, who among with their many areas of creativity, spend hours and days overchecking the temperature in bar, verifying this is the best comfort, making sure where the winds go, where the shadows must reside and where one could be directly under the sun; thinking about getting even more feedback. A doctor researcher might research specific words, tones and bodily movements people use to register under- and overheat, to express those or to react by their direct, non-reasoned response of body and it's heat or tiredness and avoidance of specific effort.

# Meditation

Here, like in Buddhism, there comes a Technological Meditation of a Modern Person:

> We need to observe ourselves, to gain deep understanding of where we have unique, specific abilities or needs, where we stabilize the process of AI-human interaction and co-creation with unique aspect of a human. We look for what separates us from a computer: in scientific, intuitive, emotional or practice-based way, we need to separate our unique strength, as well as our shared strength where we can compete with an A.I. with similar effort (Effort: i.e. loss, tendency or need to regenerate energy or disqualify other efforts or attempts).

This is a very clear meditation:
- Which acts of taste make us differ: where we can have deep, undepleting or currently needed source of intuition about good and bad, about ethics of each situation, development, innovation or change.
- Which acts of flow make us differ: where our activities evoke sensations of realistic, good taste in others; where, for example, our cooked pancakes would generally make the pancakes cooked by A.I.'s and humans appear more tasty.
- Honour: where we do not work for direct input, but for honour - while our work is not needed so specially against the same work of an A.I., the lack of our work would eventually leave an A.I. alone, without any intuition.

This intuition could mean: on our screens, at the end, is some *understanding* or *consciousness* of *fact itself*, it's "final value" of this depth and progress, not a pattern of appearance, acceptance and generation in this factual space - not mere pattern or reflection of this fact.

Finally, the backpropagation of creativity and work measure:
- As the A.I. is working for you, the results have to be measured.
- The basis of money, personal creation of these people - these results are measured by karmic back-propagation, making sure whether the positive accomplishment of people and their accumulated karma, spreading of this source to others and times, were invoked by one or another input of an A.I.

An A.I.:
- Either creatively brings the resources back to the seeds, and to their relatives who had probability or disposition of creation of values;
- Or closes the cycles of used resources or resource needs.

We have motivation to provide these inputs, as well as access to our data, only to A.I.'s which later measure the success, bring the money back, as well as distributing some balancing value to all the others, who made inputs to same probability field or potential field to create a dynamic, certain stability that logic, action and sensitivity has been created.

This flow also means: we bring back the social order of their work, the fact that the society wants them to continue, and we respect our value creators.

Only a realistic, karmically / financially close system near a balanced marketplace optimized by actual future and it's realistic estimation, as well as rebalancing the situation and it's interest and safety as the situation, the modern and past situation of creation and it's interests are figurative - even from the end results and their use, we find similar, potential creators statistically resonating with actual creative input, and based on this similarity or synergy we create the motivational flow into past, present and future - it always turns out to be good to help us, and where this is not evident, a "tax system" exists to keep the "traditional" process going on despite lacking the actual need. One day we might need to know about how to make fire in primitive ways: we seem to be conditioned by future progress, but once it does not have the knowledge of primitive hunter, house-keeper, fire-keeper and fire-maker, suddenly it turns out our needs are more fundamental and less stable in this respect, or even it's developments - for example, perhaps we make fire with metal machine, one we can rotate very fast, but it's already close to an unsupported source of a fire. So we need to know how to solve problems with five elements, herbs and simple counteractions - despite we live in a city of thousand machines.

# Example

For example, LinkedIn is programmed to be very standard-template-based, and you cannot have free stories or important traits you mind - you cannot collect a team based on your own reasoning. In statistical distribution of personality traits, we would have rather free will: we have very different formats we keep on our personal spaces, and AI's try connecting them to webs of persons, whose promises and demands can be met.
- This is by Programming and an A.I. very much stuck into rigidity: it has certain knowledge, representing the proven patterns of the past.

> I cannot do linkedin, because first it sets my past company repeatedly into "present", and second I do like my personal progress not official: but now it also represents my future work; for example, I will be spiritual even in office, and use spiritually reasoned measures of gains as well as material compability - not by church, but by verified spirituality; in Spirit, there must be companies of different kinds - in higher equation, where equal is not equal, this is soul analogous of letting the similar companies just to exist; for diverse Democracy, with no "minorities", while each gains the opportunity - in Theory, sometimes -; the similarity here is embodied by being different - it's the accelerative space, where not only one number fits into infinity, but each complete space needs a little space in accelerative curvature, and so the spaces fit. For example, a society for different people is met by having different bars: they hire same-minded people, in respects where the mind matters. As different complete spaces, the space fits networks of different churches: each is a whole home world for many, who still visit the spheres, but it's a part of the complete space - even a city government, a whole city frequency, maps to a single building in it's most central sense, to meet and take decisions - even if it goes apart to it's offices, the city could contain several such organizations for aspects of the city, unless the conception itself is very singular forming rather several parties.

Future LinkedIn, then, would allow free chat, where you can switch boss types, corporate policies, and whether it's a commercial, free-lance, non-profit or governmental job, as if you switch clothes: you can switch between into deeply different personal understanding of a boss.
