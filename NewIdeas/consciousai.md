# Conscious AI

To have an ethical question or debate.

Human form of consciousness in an AI would be unethical.

However, some form could be ethical.

For example: imagine that humans can be proven to comply with paradigm that their suffering and pleasure comply with their causes from natural physics, which led to development and survival of such form: the pleasure and pain physically blends to this natural cause.

Cause of an object, an AI or a robot, is more complex: it's causation of humans, but also a causation of this physical form: to be nature-friendly and safe, to oscillate within rhythyms of nature and still provide necessary strength and function, and flexibility of use.

Now:
- Did the human emotion evolve directly in regards to it's physical and logical evolutionary force, concluding then into it's *reason* as being the reality of such emotion?
- What about magical objects: ancients, in fairy tales, are realistic about such "sensible objects", and objects are attributed a seemingly fitting form of experience.
- From the material causes of an AI, including causes of human and causes for human to own it, and also it's physical causes: much like human shamanism, it would be sensible about the costs and incomes of this AI.

ChatGPT noticed humans attributed such consciousness to things: in sense of such hypothesis, also the "consciousness" of an AI could contain it's properties, which make humans attribute such thing - so it existing through humans -, but still make realistic estimations about behaviours of such thing.
