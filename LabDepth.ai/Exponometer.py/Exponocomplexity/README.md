# Exponometer complexity handling with complex numbers

Currently we have internal layers x, y, z; weights and biases, and second set of weights and biases: even in one-element vector and matrix of
our presentation, this complexity level of a primitive is hard. We normally want to think in little primitives, and we cannot have more than
a few mixed with our few personal considerations - I have seen from 100-150 lines, my interest of *programs of others* drops and becomes work
on it, from simple "scanning" or "reading" to illustrate a concept or bring in. Thus, most of the code here has complexity removed and represents
their bare function to those, who want simple or advanced implementations with their own complexities solved.
