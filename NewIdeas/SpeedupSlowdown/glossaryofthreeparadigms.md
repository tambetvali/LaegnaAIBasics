# **This glossary of three paradigms in AI study, automation and imaginations**

**Three paradigms:**

---

- **Simplified paradigm:** *matrix, list-vector, matrix and vector calculus.*
  - **Short-term display**
  - **Non-projective spaces:** space where this appears combines a *single experience/sample* on local basis of its own space,
    which is visible in matrix form and code.
  - **Optimization:** step or sample forms *input=>output mapping* as single instance, and inference or interaction will use this
    mapping to solve real-life problems.

---

- **Advanced paradigm:** tensors, tensor fields, tensor calculus
  - **Long-term effects**
  - **Projective spaces:** the space where this happens is *not encoded into single sample*, but through weak interactions of samples.
    Local tensions combine into multisample interactions, and space appears where connections are not simply *1to1 of input and output*,
    but *space2space* of vector of samples and their interactions.
  - Tension forms tensors into their **most comfortable shape**.
  - Epochs and training sessions resolve higher space tension to provide estimations of such space, and to use it as resolution
    to new samples.

---

- **Intuitive paradigm:** this is for *“end user”* or intuitive studier, such as boss of scientific group
  - **Correlation with mental organisms**
    - Intuitions about **quality** or **quantity** optimized people
    - Instinctive, intuitive and experience‑based understanding of matrixes based on this correlation to object they map
    - Given we live among neural networks and material process, and are evolved to study and respond to such systems
      - This does not occur in rational thinking, but direct sense occurring in our nerve system itself is projected into
        *holistic, topological and generic display* into our central nerve system.  
        The rational thought estimates such inside‑neurons as *black box*, and intuitive understanding forms even in your
        secretary or blondine girlfriend: they will understand the **question and answer model**, and process where AI both
        responds based on their experience (training, fine‑tuning), executes habits (inference), and is stuck with the same
        problems as you — problems with **attention**, **disperse and clouded thinking** about large contexts and need to take notes,
        as well as other things it does not necessarily learn from samples, but still shares with your psychology.

I will write the chapter in nearby hours or days, until then you enjoy this into.
