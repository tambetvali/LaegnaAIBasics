# First-order logic processing

> As a mental framing of linearizing the logic processes.

First-order logic processing is high in it's optimization level: it's intented to work outside the scope of demanding Artificial Intelligence, but combined into imperative and functional paradigm and perhaps, Machine Learning (vs. General Deep Learning). Let's call this a Special Deep Learning, if we assist Machine Learning with deep learning strategy.

Let's try to use Deep Learning algorithm to assist in Machine Learning.

## What I mean by linearized logic?

We use finite sets, given "small" numbers: small numbers are achieved by tiny exponent factor, which still occurs in parallel. Multiplication of numbers in processor indeed calculates with exponential local growth, whole removed dimension by simplification of digits, where value of lower digit influences higher digit; still above it's local barrier it might look linear. For a scientist, still, in the range they work in, e1/n, n \* 10^(1/n) is often applied to remove the exponential growth in their subject matter; number will become not only linear, but atomic - their growth becomes logarithmic and we can use bigger and bigger numbers in roughly the same amount of paper and pencil time.

Function headers we use in logical, imperative and functional programming are themselves linear - the exponent factor, to appear, in fact, must be constructed in constructor, and the nature of mathematical reality under one such function header is often linear - classes, generalizations and other means are used to add this "simplicity" in subject matter; this might be not necessarily inheret in function structure itself: we can still combine questions, whose answers appear in exponent growth, but this is not the nature of logic itself, for example giving yes and no answers - with yes and no answer, a question's evaluation space is "ordinal", a small number and this linear.

#### To resolve Machine Learning task with Deep Learning
