## 🌈 How this structure helps users

The structure of LaegnaAIBasics is intentionally **modular and layered**:

- a **clear core** for understanding Deep Learning  
- **extensions and experiments** for deeper exploration  
- **collaborative context** for integration and expansion  

Users can treat this repo as:

- a **learning base** for Deep Learning  
- a **conceptual bridge** into Laegna / Spireason thinking  
- a **starting point** for AI‑enhanced documentation and theory building

From here, it is easy to branch into related repositories such as:

- **LaegnaDocumentation**  
- **LaeSpiEssentialTheorems**

which expand the same universe of ideas into broader research and symbolic foundations.
