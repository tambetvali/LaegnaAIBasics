# 1. 🌱 Start Here

## **1.1 About the Project**  
**[File](about.md), [Folder](Intro/):** `about.md`, `Intro/README.md`  
A conceptual introduction to the project.  
Explains:

- the perceptron as the “central atom” of AI  
- how simple units scale into complex architectures  
- how extended logic, number systems, and symbolic structures relate  
- how LaegnaAIBasics helps organize materials for AI use  
- how everyday users can benefit without deep technical knowledge  

This is the recommended first read.

# 2. 🚀 Getting Started

## **2.1 Practical Onboarding**  
**[File](Intro/gettingstarted.md):** `gettingstarted.md`  
A hands‑on guide covering:

- how to prepare a workspace (Notion, Obsidian, VSCode)  
- how to store text, media, and binary files  
- how to describe files so AI can use them  
- how to begin with simple tasks  
- how to grow toward advanced exploration  

Ideal for users who want to start using AI immediately.

# 3. 📐 Visual Overview

## **3.1 System Diagrams**  
**[File](Intro/visual.md):** `visual.md`  
A GitHub‑friendly diagram file showing:

- the flow from human knowledge → LaegnaAIBasics → AI systems → outputs  
- perceptron diagrams  
- architecture scaling diagrams  
- workflow diagrams (collections → interfaces → AI → artifacts)  
- conceptual learning path diagrams  

This file provides the visual backbone of the documentation.

# 4. 🗂️ Collections

## **4.1 Organizing Materials for AI**  
**[File](Intro/collections.md):** `collections.md`  
Explains how to:

- structure notes, media, PDFs, and code  
- create metadata and descriptions  
- build collections that AI can ingest  
- maintain clarity and consistency  
- support both simple and advanced workflows  

This is the practical foundation for using AI with personal or project materials.

# 5. 🔌 Interfaces

## **5.1 How AI Systems Interact with Collections**  
**[File](Intro/interface.md):** `interface.md`  
Describes:

- instruct–chat patterns  
- document ingestion (RAG)  
- multimodal inputs  
- activity triggers  
- tool and API interactions  
- how collections feed into AI systems  

This file explains the “bridge” between stored materials and AI outputs.

# 6. 🧩 How the Files Fit Together

\`\`\`text
about.md          → conceptual foundation  
getting-started.md → practical onboarding  
visual.md          → diagrams and structural overview  
collections.md     → how to organize materials  
interface.md       → how AI uses those materials  
\`\`\`

Together, these files form a complete learning and usage path:

1. **Understand the core idea** (about.md)  
2. **Set up a workspace** (getting-started.md)  
3. **See the big picture visually** (visual.md)  
4. **Organize materials effectively** (collections.md)  
5. **Use AI systems with those materials** (interface.md)

# 7. 📦 Suggested Repository Structure

\`\`\`text
LaegnaAIBasics/(+Intro*)
│
├── about.md
├── getting-started.md
├── visual.md
├── collections.md
├── interface.md
└── ...   ← (the rest)
\`\`\`

This structure keeps the documentation clean, discoverable, and logically ordered.

* Intro, Rooted: the files from root folder were later moved into intro and rooted folders.
