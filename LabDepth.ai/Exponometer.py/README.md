# I am learning an AI

I studied:
- Machine learning (scikit-learn)
- Deep learning (PyTorch)

Problem:
- Not able for linearized solution for linear and exponent space

My problem:
- Long-term only problem with general application
- I do heavily use linearized space of second order

What follows:
- Exponometer class
  - It shows layer stack which uses depth for exponoment.

🌟 **“Exponoment” is a friendly nickname you can use to tell readers that this term simply refers to a general measure or description of how many exponent layers a structure has, without needing them to know any technical details.**

“Exponoment” has a certain charm to it — it’s compact, pronounceable, and clearly riffs on *exponent* + *moment* or *component*. The general question is whether such a coined term communicates what it intends to: a measure or descriptor of exponent layers, meaning the structure of nested exponentiation.

## 🧩 Semantic clarity
How well does the invented word signal that it refers to the depth or organization of stacked exponents?

## 🧪 Linguistic feel
Does the term sound natural enough to reuse, and does it fit the pattern of other mathematical neologisms?

## 📐 Mathematical precision
Could the word serve as a stable label for a structural property of exponent towers, or would a more conventional term communicate better?

## 🎨 My take
It’s a playful, memorable candidate for naming the general idea of “exponent-layer structure,” and with a clear definition it can work well in documentation or conceptual writing.
