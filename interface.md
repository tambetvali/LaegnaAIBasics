# Ideal interface

I wanted to point out that what has been developed with lovely.dev, bolt.new and v0 by vercel is kind of an ideal interface and we should seek this for different capabilities:

## Control Flow

### Instruction box

At the main page, in the beginning, the multiline textbox where one writes an instruction: a query to build an AI product, such as webpage or webapp, movie or a bot.

Sometimes, it directly starts to build, sometimes there is the planning session chat or a few questions before it starts to fulfill the intention.

### Main loop

#### Chat panel

Mostly on left, sometimes at right side, there is the chat window where one can discuss about fixes and improvements.

#### Preview and editing, the content / document

The main part is the content, where one can preview their product. For example, it shows splash screen when one is waiting for the product; it shows editors when the AI is building it up, and the central purpose is to allow one to preview and try the functions and the views as the product is developing up.

#### Deploy button

At top bar of buttons and menus, mostly on the right side, there are Version Control Integration and Deployment functions.

Deploy button allows one to get their app into the production - it produces the URL or the locator, builds the product and deploys it on the web server.

### Agile development

In beginning of agile development one has no money for this product. It's very important that the free functions are useful to do something meaningful, and to provide the same free interface for the clients. The paid options should not easily appear before one has capable income from their product, because the product development is not their investor but actually pais for the real business products with income, after the product is delivered - this is my philosophy and while some people might have free money, it's better to join sustainable communities.
