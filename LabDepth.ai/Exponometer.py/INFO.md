# Node: Folder

```conf
   parent=LabDepth.ai
   parentattr=Exponometer.py
```

Abstraction class:
- Anytree is mathematical theory of any tree
- First level ordinal logic
- Linear structure - like logic table
- Every `Node` inherits `from anytree import Node`
  - class(Anytree)=>class(Node)

Parent:
- Where an item appears

Parent Attribute:
- How the parent shall name them, as an attribute
  - "`attr.attr`": in parent, attribute attr has child attribute attr.
  - "`attr.attr`": parent has UserList implementation of Python collections and it's example file UserList.py in Python's tree.
    - Three canonic User collections
    - You can create UserClass which can derive, by ovverriding the seek for things you derive
      - Parent calls initializers, inherits which make child renew with inherit class
      - Tools, drivers, models change and invoke local globals: for each child, in-context, topmost parent has projective
        geometry with varying model, driver, tool. GPT creates layer specification for every token, and each parent is seen
        in projection metaphysically similar to class of it's imaginary parent node, when you hide the last node and follow
        masked calculation to compare with last step.
      - Branching and versioning
        - New version or "derivative" (in syntactic sense) takes "live pointers" to identify connections
        - Branch version or "child" will
          - not create signals of recreation of instance: class is changing, but instance is not changing.
            - For this, instance decides the class: pointer does not
              - You *explicitly* convert such pointers and class cannot do multiple casting *at the same time*,
                without explicit or grammatical threading.
      - Keys and tickets
        - ticket on your deck identifies itself as child of any node outside or inside the system;
          - internal and external servers or who run your open source script and open source AI script, to form
            *open serverside http protocol "**open backend**"*.
          - ticket pongs it's request; the ping will follow as response:
            1. Response 1: timeout signal of various degrees, which follow the initial timeout with new timeout events such as days.
               - these are considered `"not" signals` $\neg signals$ of the ping: inactive for first timeout, inactive for service timeout, inactive for archive
                 removal from local in-memory scope.
            2. Response 2:
               - these are considered ***allow***, which is also $\neg \neg signals$ by it's symmetric consequence.
            3. Response 3:
               - ***not permitted***. response might follow, or permitted track: for example, guest alternative of general link impression activity.
                 - with "log in" button for script or human.
                   - script must access mock automata: this emulates the system
                   - compressed form is "summary", but it divides time and information space by factor of summarizing n-chunks of texts, and stream
                     of n-slices which are sized chunks of tokens in stream, not in string.
                     - memory magic is often manual: deep programmers do eat and administrators track throlss, spam and hacker who pass Turing test
                       alone, for their roles with their Artificial Stupidity algorithms for Servers. Hackers hack their algorithm together.

Parentattr:
- Parent folder contains the file or folder node under this name
  - under low-level specifiers, type can be "file" or "folder", and "owner_id" of file and folder is the same, if index.html or index.php projects
    into folder output; for folder there can be alt link if this html does not list a folder, or ftp; in markdown scripts, some forms use parent
    folder's md file, which has named for the folder name: here, I would say using extension for folder for this purpose, and BOM.md file which
    explains the format in Markdown or identifies a common template or class, an instance which uses provider's deck and derives from that format
    into it's dialect and local hooks or specifications.
    - AI can naturally yield from the format by short specifier, which is either logical: then it has complexity of one object; or it has
      irrationally bounded parts, in which it has complexity of number of parts - this easily, an *exponent* and every exponent is dangerous
      spender, but it's used for exponent credit: several AI models of each owner, fine-tuned, make a collective be their context.
      - timestamps, where timestamp and clock correction version of timestamp coordinate block is used;
        - when document is enchanged, both servers exchange permanent local timestamps and copy timestamps for one-level coordination of the
          tree
          - version timestampOfQ&A1.timestampOfQ&A2
            - by assigning numbers after one dot: timestampOfQ&A1.5.timestampOfQ&A2
              - version 5: just counts that this server has already assigned 4 stamps
                - is better if those are very local
      - version agreement
        - servers agree to move version
        - versions are ordinary numbers and if version is later in process, it's always bigger - no matter whether it's a version below,
          or above in the tree.

Trees:
- ***Tree 1***: unified folder and md file structures
  - I propose: in database, folder identifier looks like "## ### #" - three document levels, which are like nodes in parent document where
    link code block of Moonlight script associates the block with next level.
    - Inside same script, when 6 levels - max of HTML, consequentively Markdown which is not complex;
      - Database tracks spaces, and without spaces, splits to lover-level, mlc or "moonlight-compile" vs. mls or "moonlight script".
      - Moonlight is my common name to track executable, non-executable, example etc. code, and thus moonlight blocks must want to do that.
        - To run others, such as execute, compile or preprocess python, or automate it based on templates for processing and their classes.
- ***Tree 2***:
  - inherits into a master node: your model's in-home traces and remaps. Where you fine-tune your model based on $Deck_{x}$, or whether you register
    inference, you can compress all the local trees into Deck.
    - You can allow only one tree with one element parent "None", where it will replace the Deck itself: Deck, now, points to Root node which
      must support interface of Deck's implementation and it's identificator code.
  - collects all root-trees of a deck, and it's own node by which all the childs identify.
    - you can have second url bar, to navigate; inside one entry point - and URL: instead of hash "#" syntax, which is not very easy.
    - maybe, you can cache backend and provide smooth transitions if parent's "#" parts changes and script reloads windows, or if parent
      url changes only to it's other provider.
    - inside, collects Q&A cards
      - various interfaces register separate trees, thus separate versioning
      - they show the *last*, not *first* version, and they try to handshake for having two specific versions where they *version* their
        documents, and *versioning* when done to other branch, and to other server, will now make the file available.
        - owner is identified: same link of repository, which is navigated by second url: local service is watching local projected
          links and html pages, but if domain is removed just "index.php" or "/index.php" or "../deckname/index.php" to point to deck
          outside; deck can have datastructure parent, not only descendant parent.

*This is an example file to fresh your mind and understand something unitary. The script will go into exponent programming.
