# Sharing the AI resources

I have an idea, that there should be a format of AI, which:
- Can be connected to user web pages, static or dynamic.
- Each web page contains sets of problems for AI
  - Given a Model and DataSet, fine-tune this model or do certain amount of fine-tuning.
  - Given the page has associated Prolog connections, given certain information and an instruction, follow a task.

Other users can create pages with solutions, link back and systematically ping you with their address to notify they are contributing.

Since rather each person, who can fine-tune some AI, wants to make it smarter:
- The format would allow to create study environments for an AI.
