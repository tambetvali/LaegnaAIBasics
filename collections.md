# Preparing for an AI

Create a document collection, which is presumably in this format:
- Folder trees are allowed, and text documents can form trees from chapter structures, such as the markdown format or pdf and word. Plain Text and mere UTF-8 do not have standardized, organized chapter structures, while HTML might have more options for positional inputs and interactivity.
-- Folders contain text materials with at least some formatting options such as bold, bullet lists and titles: markdown (md) is the preferred format, plain-text (txt) is often the simplest but could actually contain markdown markup without contradiction, especially utf-8 for advanced plain text; PDF is popular format summorted by many, HTML+JS+CSS can contain documents up to interaction and advanced formatting and labelling.
-- Anki or other models can be allowed for question-answer pairs or other standard AI inputs, where context-question-answer triple is probably better format for organized content with attachments, sources and related materials which can be automatically found and related to example contexts it learns.
-- Very advanced or otherwise specialized systems can include interactive content: video, sound, 2D and 3D models, intellectual content, custom formats and nodes/elements such as templates and variables.
- Otherwise, specialized document tree formats can be used
-- VSCode document folder, which represents a single system of organized design, code and development, can be associated with free GitHub repository; Artificial Intelligent can be installed - this is Chat and Archive system. VSCode plugins might be able to automatically deploy to free and paid systems.
-- Obsidian basically creates VSCode markdown document structure with visual interface and allows archiving and publishing into github, which is collective development and iteration system.
-- Notion.so is webbased interface, where you do this in hidden, AI-accessible format with WYSIWYG editor, a conception similar to Word where the format is very cryptic, but there are many tools which can work on it on their primitive level.

So your mission:
- Personal critical knowledge of most use
- Documents of your developments and assessments
- Personal theoretical work or work on interactive or representation materials such as videos and sound
- Associated materials, such as your profiles, images and videos of greeting or world-presentation of you, such as name age sex type of introduction, pictures of visit cards or public coordinates and phones, as well as CV or other contact materials or limitations.

Organize these materials into folders in single document collection, or have several if you want to distribute them to chunks to digest less materials at once - now you can feed the github url into web-based instruct-chat-deploy (ICD in my language) interfaces and tools to develop solutions based on your standardized information map, idea map and task map, project or it's estimated, possible courses.

This is the standard, non-organized/organized collection of your general background and input for specific tasks, where AI can use and represent this for various projects and results, such as web pages, presentations, logos and slogans or videos about your products, ideas, or suggestions such as health suggestions or professional warnings and advice, spiritual practices or theoretical materials.

This remains to represent you: each document collection gets a metal-backed soul, which is not getting sick or taking free time unless you lack credits, able to represent you and your ideas and remain in oscillation of your previous actions like God's avatar in hindu mythology: not god, but appearing from it multidimensional looks and likes, or avatar technology in the avatar movie, representing you as a robot avatar and repating your experience and training sessions: for example, it could cook like you, after making some, several, or multitude of movies for example-based matching of patterns or personal training and coaching for an AI system.
