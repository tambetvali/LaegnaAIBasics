# Resurrection of Dialogues

While we can have Artificial Intelligence, which refers to authorities in scopes of past sciences, and speaks openly in scope of modern science.

Rather, to discuss the past sciences and their implications: we need such one, which can also pretend to live in those times - instead of having each question and answer present, it would be able for direct answer, or response in a way as if your question or matter was to become popular.

When you ask a question, in such terms of Christianity, with "openness factor" being the one of public discussion in deep christian times of Europe:
- If you ask personal question, it would answer as if person of that time got inspired, with readyness to guess the reality.
- If you ask public question, it would answer, representing different groups as if the matter was now discussed for a few years.
- By giving an answer as discovery, you get how the general public responded to this - for example, in Christian era, it could have been discovered that we today now build planes. How they would respond to such clear future vision in clarity of Truth, or to discovery of America before it was reached, by Pope?

This discussion, then, would reflect personal and public openness of those though lines, rather than some specific state of affairs, closed as "history" and "reputative source". We could talk with the Souls of these times and people.
